## Things Learned
1. Started the project using PERN stack and using self writted css styling you can check that out here - https://github.com/Rohitkk432/Bon-Appetit.git
2. Wanted to try something new then came across a graphql video tutorial and started again from scratch using MERNG that is MERN stack using graphql to query and fetch.
3. Wanted to make a better looking UI and i am not so good at it without a UI designer on my team as it is a solo project. So used Material Ui this time rather than regular CSS that i am comfortable with . (went through Fluent UI, React-Bootstrap , Material Ui before then choose to use Material UI).
4. Deployed server on heroku and client on netlify without issues this time last project faced cors issues.

## Things Played around with
1. Tried to use Graphql still havent learned or unleashed any high level of it just used it in a basic way.
2. Will learn and try using other tools like Hasura , etc in future projects to use graphql efficiently.
3. Had never used mongodb before so it was a new thing to try which was a rather nice experience using graphql.
4. Eplored UI frameworks and tried using it (used Material UI).
